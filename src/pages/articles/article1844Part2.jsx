        <h2>Evolution of the 1844 doctrine</h2>
        <p>
          The 1844 doctrine or Sanctuary doctrine of the Seventh-day Adventists
          underwent several iterations from the time of Miller before reaching
          its final form as Seventh-day Adventists know it today. Let&apos;s now
          take a quick look at the evolution of this unique doctrine of
          Seventh-day Adventists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having been born and raised as a Seventh-day Adventist, I have heard
          about the 1844 doctrine but I had very little knowledge about it.
          Sometimes I hear 1844 being mentioned in sermons and in evangelical
          crusades that I had attended growing up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I had no deep understanding of this doctrine yet, by seeing
          the charts and hearing the explanations, my young mind at that time
          was convinced that this doctrine was correct, although I don&apos;t
          fully understand it. It&apos;s like seeing a math professor solve a
          complex equation and in a few minutes time, the whole whiteboard was
          filled with the numbers and symbols until arriving at the correct
          solution. That&apos;s how I felt when I saw the charts, the symbols,
          the graphics. Like smoke and mirrors in a magic show, I was
          mesmerized.

          Like I&apos;ve mentioned before, William Miller derived 1844 at a much
          later date, with the help of Edward Snow and also after 1843 failed.
          He was focused on the year 1843 as that is what his calculations were

              than seven times 360 revolutions of earth in its orbit, making
              2520 years. I believe this began according to Jeremiah 15:4,

          <p>
            My initial reaction upon reading Miller&apos;s 1st proof is one of
            bewilderment. How does one even think that by
            <strong>
              <em>
                &nbsp;multiplying 7 by 360 to get 2520 and then turn it to years

            </strong>
            to get the date of the return of the Lord?.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let&apos;s try to unravel Miller&apos;s logic on how he derived his
            proof, but before we do that. We need to accept a few assumptions.
            You do not need to agree with this but in order to understand
            Miller&apos;s thinking, we have to think like Miller. So let&apos;s
            get on to it.

        <p>
          For now, we will not be discussing the validity of the day-year
          principle. For the sake of understanding Miller&apos;s proof, we just
          have to accept this assumption as valid.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Assumption 2: Whenever year or <em>“times”</em> are mentioned in
            prophecy, this always refers to 360 days &nbsp;
          </strong>
          <em>(which can be converted to years if needed)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          We all know that <u>a year is equivalent to about 365 and 1/4 days</u>
          . The ancients were also aware that a year contains more than 360
          days. Even the Babylonians who employed a 360-day calendar needed to
          add an extra month at irregular intervals to compensate for the
          missing days. If intercalary days were not added, then the 360 day
          calendar year would have missing days and would not correspond to our
          current timeline.
        </p>

          <strong>360-day calendar vs 365-day calendar</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a 360-day calendar year will be 5 less days than a
          365-day calendar like the ones we have. But every 4 years, we add 1
          day to the month of February to make up for the missing ¼ day yearly.
          So 4 years in a 360-day calendar <em>(without intercalation)</em> will
          be 21 days less than our 365-day calendar
          <em>(which is more accurate)</em>.

          &nbsp;<em>(4 years)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the 360-day calendar without intercalation for 100 years, would
          result in 525 fewer days or around 1 1/2 years to the current time.
          This would make it seem that the 360-day calendar is ahead by 1 1/2
          years. Using this 360-day calendar without intercalation for 1000
          years would result in a missing 5250 days or 14 years and 3 months
          compared to the current time. So using this 360-day calendar for 2300
          years without intercalation would result in 12,075 days lacking or
          equivalent to 33 years. This would make the 360-day calendar ahead by
          33 years if used for a span of 2300 years.

          . Maybe the prophetic year <em>(360-day)</em> is just like the
          commercial year <em>(also 360 days)</em> in the finance world. But
          unless the prophetic timelines don&apos;t corresponed to reality,
          using this 360-day calendar wouldn&apos;t align with the dates of
          history. So let&apos;s just forget reality for now. It&apos;s always

          Now that we have those 2 assumptions in place, let&apos;s now take a
          look at Miller&apos;s 1st proof. How did Miller come up with 2520
          years again? He got this from Leviticus 26:18-27. Let&apos;s look at
          verse 18.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <em>
            “If after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for
            your sins seven times over.” Leviticus 26:18.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Miller believed that the people of God had been captured in Babylon
          <em>&nbsp;(literal and mystical)</em> for a period of 2520 years. That
          is the{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>seven times</strong>
          </em>{" "}
          mentioned in Leviticus 26:18 &nbsp;
          <em>
            <strong>multiplied by 360</strong>
          </em>{" "}
          which according to Miller, are the
          <em>
            <strong>360 revolutions of the earth in its orbit</strong>
          </em>
          , and voila, you get 2520, which also according to Miller is
          equivalent to 2520 years. Ok, so now that Miller has 2520 years, then
          how did it end up in 1843? Miller believed that a Messianic prophecy
          which is found in Isaiah 7:14-17 has an initial fulfillment which is
          the starting date of the 2520 year prophecy.
        </p>
        <p align="center">

          According to Miller&apos;s interpretation, from the time that this
          prophecy was given, <strong>65 years</strong> will pass and Ephraim
          will be too shattered to be a people. Miller believed that this
          prophecy was given in <strong>742 BC</strong>, if you subtract 65
          years from that, you will get <strong>677 BC</strong>, which Miller
          believed was when Manasseh was taken captive by the Assyrians. Thus,
          677 BC is the starting date of the 2520 year prophecy. Subtract that
          from 2520 and you get 1843.

          But was Miller correct in his proof? According to him, based from
          Isaiah 7:8, From the time that the prophecy was given
          <strong>(742 BC)</strong> to 65 years later
          <strong>(677 BC)</strong> Manasseh will be carried captive to Babylon
          and Israel will no longer be a nation, but archaeological records show
          that in 721 BC, Samaria fell to Assyria and its inhabitants were
          deported and replaced with other inhabitants. So 742 BC couldn&apos;t
          have been the starting point of the prophecy in Isaiah 7:8 because in
          742 BC, Israel was no longer a nation, when in Isaiah 7:8 says, in 65
          years, Ephraim <em>(which is a part of Israel)</em> will be too
          shattered to be a people, meaning at the time the prophecy was given,
          they were not yet shattered. If 742 BC couldn&apos;t be the starting
          point of the prophecy, then 677 BC couldn&apos;t be the end point of
          that prophecy also. Then it means that 677 BC couldn&apos;t be the
          starting point of 2520 and 2520 is also just a <em>“magic”</em>{" "}
          number, calculated by multiplying 7 by 360. Ok then, let&apos;s get on
          to the next proof, perhaps it offers more substance.

              anyone among their own people, because the Lord&apos;s time for

        <p>
          According to Miller, God&apos;s people will be delivered from bondage
          after they have served 7 prophetic years. 7 prophetic years multiplied
          by 360 years is 2520. And not surprisingly, the starting date of that
          is also 677 BC which, according to Miller is Manasseh&apos;s arrest
          and captivity of Israel from proof number 1. But we now know how
          improbable that is, then we also know how valid Miller&apos;s 2nd
          proof is.

          This proof is certainly more complicated than the ones we&apos;ve
          discussed. But let&apos;s try to understand this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here, Miller reasoned that there are 7 Jewish Sabbaths, but the Jews
          were only able to keep 6 out of the 7. According to Miller,
          <blockquote>
            <em>
              “if they [the Jews] had kept the seventh they would have been made
              perfect without us; but they broke the seventh.”
            </em>
          </blockquote>
          So if only they were able to keep the all 7 Sabbaths then they would
          have been made perfect. I don&apos;t know about you but this sounds
          like salvation by works to me. Anyways, let&apos;s proceed to examine

          As you can see, Miller conveniently pointed out the pattern of
          Sabbaths as observed by the Israelites. You will notice that this is
          arranged in increasing order, starting from the weekly, 50th day, 7th
          week, 7th month, 7th year and to the culmination which was the Jubilee
          of Jubilees or 49 times 50 years. But I don&apos;t know if Miller was
          aware that number 2, which is the 50th day and number 3 which is the
          7th week, is talking of the same Sabbath Festival, that is the
          Festival of Weeks? So this would make his list just 6 Sabbaths instead
          of 7. And he conveniently left out Yom Kippur or the Day of Atonement
          which was also observed as a Sabbath. In fact, Jews call this the
          <strong>
            <em>&quot;Sabbath of Sabbaths&quot;</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          and this occurs once a year.

              work—whether native-born or a foreigner residing among you—
              because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse
              you. Then, before the Lord, you will be clean from all your sins.
              It is a day of sabbath rest, and you must deny yourselves; it is a
              lasting ordinance. Lev. 16:29-31

          The only reason I can think of why Miller would leave this out is
          because it would break his pattern of increasing order in relation to
          seven. But maybe he should&apos;ve just added this instead of
          duplicating the festival of weeks, who knows? But it doesn&apos;t
          matter anyway because this reasoning is faulty to begin with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then we come to the 7th in his list of Sabbaths which according to him
          was not observed by the Israelites, and that is the Jubilee of
          Jubilees or 49 x 50 = 2450 years. This is not found anywhere in the
          Bible nor in any way alluded to. How would the Israelite even know
          that they should multiply the seven times seven by the 50th year? This
          is possible only with a <s>little bit</s> a lot of imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as you can see from the equation, this proof has a different
          starting date, and that is 607 BC. But what is significant in 607 BC?
          you might ask, Well according to Miller, this is the end of the reign
          of King Josiah of Judah. After his death, the kingdom of Judah stopped
          observing the jubilee. Miller believed that the Israelites were only
          able to observe 21 jubilees, still lacking 28 more in order to
          complete the 49 jubilees, leading to the 50th. Thus, 7 x 7 jubilees
          (49) x 50 = 2450.
        </p>
        <p>
          But according to historical records&nbsp;
          <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Josiah"
            target="_blank"

          >
            King Josiah
          </a>
          &nbsp; reigned from 640-609 BCE. That&apos;s about 2 years off from
          Miller&apos;s date, but let&apos;s grant him this for now, maybe the
          timeline was off during Miller&apos;s day so let&apos;s go with that.
          So if you subtract 607 from 2450, then you would get 1843 again. And
          not surprisingly, 607 BC also was the date used by Jehovah&apos;s
          Witnesses when they predicted the end of the world on 1914. But what
          they believed was 607 BC was year of the destruction of Jerusalem by
          Babylon and instead of subtracting that from 2450, they subtracted
          instead from 2520 years
          <em>(see proof 1)</em> to get to 1914. The Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses
          know better to add 1 year to the date because there is no year 0 in
          the calendar, which the Millerites at that time haven&apos;t thought
          of. It&apos;s not strange that the Seventh-day Adventist and
          Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses would share these same convuluted
          calculations because they both came out of the Millerite movement. The
          Adventists stuck with 1844 but now believes that it was the start of
          Jesus&apos; high priestly ministry in the Most Holy Place in heaven,
          while the Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses went with 1914 but now believes
          that Jesus began his rule as King of God&apos;s Kingdom in 1914.
          Pretty strange indeed.

          Let&apos;s now go to the last proof we&apos;ll cover but this would be
          the most important one.

              horn, which Daniel was informed was 2300 days long. Dan. 8:13,14;
              &quot;Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto

            As I was reading about Miller&apos;s proofs, I can&apos;t help but

            . I am not a medical expert by any means but it is defined in
            Merriam-Webster dictionary as
            <strong>
              <em>
                “the tendency to perceive a connection or meaningful pattern
                between unrelated or random things (such as objects or ideas)”.
              </em>
            </strong>
            &nbsp; In Miller&apos;s quest to discover the date of the
            Lord&apos;s return, I think that his mind must have latched on to
            the idea that 1843 is the date that the Bible points to. As the
            saying goes,
            <em>“All roads lead to Rome”.</em> His proofs point to 1843. He
            couldn&apos;t see it any other way.

          This is referred to as{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>“Pareidolia”</em>
          </strong>
          . Pareidolia is defined as
          <strong>
            <em>
              “the tendency to perceive a specific, often meaningful image in a
              random or ambiguous visual pattern.”
            </em>
          </strong>
          Pareidolia is a type of Apophenia, or rather a visual type of
          apophenia. In Miller&apos;s case, the number 1843 appears constantly
          in his proofs and has convinced him and others who believed him that
          the Bible points to this date. Even when the date failed to pass, they
          reckoned they must&apos;ve just had an error in their calculation.
          After 1843 came and went, that&apos;s when they realized that they had
          miscalculated because they failed to take into account that there was
          no year zero in the calendar. Unlike real numbers in mathematics, if
          you subtract 1 year from 1 BC, you will get 1 AD instead of 0 AD. So
          that&apos;s what Miller did, he added 1 to 1843 to correct it and
          that&apos;s how he got to 1844.
