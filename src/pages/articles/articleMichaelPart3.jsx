            <u>Michael In Catholicism</u>
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Michael is highly revered in Catholicism. He is called St. Michael the
          Archangel and is considered as the patron saint of warriors and
          protectors (e.g., soldiers, police, firefighters etc). He is also the
          protector of the nation of Israel and of the Catholic church. He is
          one of the 7 archangels and is the commander of the armies of heaven.
          This tradition along with many of the traditions concerning Michael
          were adopted from Judaism, particularly from the 2nd Temple
          Literature. The 7 archangels are believed to be the 7 spirits of God
          and is represented by the menorah mentioned in Revelation 4:5

          <strong>The Seven Spirits of God</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When Constantine converted to Christianity, he held Michael in high
          regard because of his warrior status. According to tradition,
          Constantine the Great ordered that a church dedicated to Michael be
          built over an ancient pagan temple and this was church was named the
          Michaelion. A statue of Michael slaying the dragon is first depicted
          at the Michaelion.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let’s begin by defining what an archangel <em>is.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          The word archangel came from the Greek word ἀρχάγγελος (arkhángelos),
          The prefix arch, meaning chief and angelos meaning messenger. This
          term obviously did not appear in the Old Testament because the Old
          Testament was originally written in Hebrew while the New Testament was
          written in Greek. So how did it get introduced in the first place?
        </p>
        <p>
          To find out how, we’re going to segue a bit and learn about the
          Scriptures used in Jesus’ day and we’re also going to learn about the
          Intertestamental literature or 2nd Temple Literature. Because I
          believe that in order to better understand the context of the biblical
          writers, one has to have an idea about their historical and cultural
          background. But if you already know about this or don’t care about it
          at all, feel free to skip this section <em>(but I hope you won’t)</em>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up as an SDA, I used to naively think that the Scriptures used
          by the people from Jesus’ time were limited to the same 39 books from
          the OT (Protestant canon). But that is not the case. The Scriptures
          that was commonly used during Jesus’ time was the Septuagint a.k.a
          LXX. The term “Septuagint” was derived from the Latin “Vetus
          Testamentum ex versione Septuaginta Interpretum” which means “The Old
          Testament from the version of the 70 Translators.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from the Septuagint and the unknown Hebrew text
          (proto-Masoretic) that the Septuagint was translated from, there was
          also the Samaritan Pentateuch, a text of the Torah written in
          Samaritan text. There was also the Dead Sea Scrolls which was first
          discovered in the 1940s in a cave in Qumran. The Dead Sea Scrolls is
          interesting because it contains fragments of most of the Hebrew Bible
          except Esther and some other apocryphal books{" "}
          <em>
            (including the War Scroll which would be of interest to our study on
            the subject of Michael)
          </em>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we’ve briefly discussed the Scriptures used during Jesus’ time,
          let’s then take a look at the Intertestamental period (between
          Testaments) as referred to by Protestants or the Deuterocanonical
          period as called by Catholics and Orthodox.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Intertestamental period covers the time period of the prophet
          Malachi (around 400 BC) up to John the Baptist’s time in the 1st
          century AD. This is commonly referred to as the “400 years of silence”
          by Protestants because they believe that during these 400 years, God
          has ceased speaking through prophets and no inspired writing came
          about until the time of the coming of the Messiah. For Jews on the
          other hand, this is the period where much of the Intertestamental
          literature was produced. Aside from the Septuagint, Dead Sea scrolls
          and Samaritan Pentateuch; the Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha and Wisdom
          Literature were also produced during this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we’ve had a little background information about the
          Intertestamental Period and Intertestamental Literature, let’s go back
          to our main topic, Michael.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michael is highly regarded by the Jews. Not only do they see Michael
          as an archangel, he is also Israel’s protector, advocate, high priest
          and prince. For example, in the book of Tobit, Michael is one of the
          seven angels who stands in the presence of God (Tobit 12:15). And in
          the non-canonical book of Enoch, Michael was said to be the angel that
          will cast the fallen angels into the abyss to execute judgment on them
          (1 Enoch 10:4, 18:1-2). Michael is also referred to as the merciful
          and long-suffering (1 Enoch 40:9). Michael also appears in a
          manuscript found in the Dead Sea scrolls called “The War of the Sons
          of Light Against the Sons of Darkness” or simply known as the War
          Scroll. In this book Michael was described as the “Prince of Light who
          will defeat the devil Belial and establish his kingdom”
        </p>
        <p>From the War Scroll:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              “This is the day appointed by Him for the defeat and overthrow of
              the Prince of the kingdom of wickedness, and He will send eternal
              succour to the company of His redeemed by the might of the
              princely Angel of the kingdom of Michael. With everlasting light
              He will enlighten with joy [the children] of Israel; peace and
              blessing shall be with the company of God. He will raise up the
              kingdom of Michael in the midst of the gods, and the realm of
              Israel in the midst of all flesh. (1QM 17.5–9)”
            </em>
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              And the Prince of Light Thou hast appointed from ancient times to
              come to our support; [all the sons of righteousness are in his
              hand], and all the spirits of truth are under his dominion. But
              Belial, the Angel of Malevolence, Thou hast created for the Pit;
              his [rule] is in Darkness and his purpose is to bring about
              wickedness and iniquity. All the spirits of his company, the
              Angels of Destruction, walk according to the precepts of Darkness;
              towards them is their [inclination] (1QM 13.10)
            </em>
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          As you can see, not only Michael was mentioned here but also Belial.
          Belial is a demon/fallen angel mentioned in 2 Corinthians 6:15.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              “What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a
              believer have in common with an unbeliever? 2 Cor. 6:15”
            </em>
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Could it be that perhaps the Jewish writers of the War Scroll are
          actually referring to the pre-incarnate Christ when they wrote this?
          If that is the case, then the Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah’s
          Witnesses are correct that Jesus and Michael are indeed one and the
          same person. But before we come to any conclusion, we will look at the
          other references and hopefully we will be able to determine the
          correct answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another apocryphal book, The Testament of Abraham, Michael is
          regarded as the one who escorts the souls of the dead to the judgment
          seat of God and he also has a role in the judgment of the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michael is also mentioned in another apocryphal book called The Life
          of Adam and Eve In this book, Michael was tasked with preventing Adam
          and Eve from accessing the tree of life in the Garden of Eden. Michael
          was also assigned by God to protect Adam and Eve after they were
          expelled from Paradise. Michael is also depicted as a mediator between
          God and humanity. He intercedes on behalf of Adam and Eve, pleading
          their cause before God and asking for their forgiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this book, it is mentioned that the devil is angry with Adam
          because the Lord made all the angels to worship Adam because he was
          made in the image of God. Michael led in the worship of Adam but the
          devil refused. When Adam died, Michael instructed Seth to prepare
          Adam’s body for burial while he transported Adam’s soul to Paradise
          and he promised Seth that Adam’s soul would return to his body on the
          day of resurrection and he will live forever in the presence of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          An expanded account of the Nephilims that was mentioned in Genesis
          6:1-4 can also be found in the Book of Enoch. The angels called
          Watchers in the book took human wives and their union produced the
          Nephilims, a hybrid of human and angelic beings of great stature. The
          Watchers also taught the humans the art of warfare, astrology, the use
          of cosmetics and other arcane stuff. This caused great evil in the
          land that’s why God destroyed the evil inhabitants of the earth by
          flood. As for the Watchers, God sent Michael to bind the Watchers
          along with their leader named Samyaza/Shemihaza.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              And to Michael [the Most High] said, “Go, Michael, bind Shemihazah
              and the others with him, who have mated with the daughters of men,
              so that they were defiled by them in their uncleanness. And when
              their sons perish and they see the destruction of their beloved
              ones, bind them for seventy generations in the valleys of the
              earth, until the day of their judgment and consummation, until the
              everlasting judgment is consummated. (1 Enoch 10:11–12)
            </em>
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          In another apocryphal book titled 3 Baruch, Michael is identified with
          traits that modern Christians would attribute to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Michael is identified as the one who holds the keys of the kingdom

              that we may enter? And the angel said to me, We cannot enter until
              Michael comes, who holds the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven;” 3

          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Another reference to Michael that can be found in Jude 1:9 is believed
          by some, including Origen, to have come from another apocryphal book
          called the Assumption of Moses a.k.a Testament of Moses. This book
          contains the supposedly last instructions of Moses to Joshua, his
          successor. But the dispute over the body of Moses&apos; account that
          is found in Jude is not found in surviving copies of this apocryphal
          book. Biblical scholars therefore think that perhaps some portions of
          the original manuscripts may have been lost or that the account was
          taken from other sources not found in any other Apocrypha. Which
          brings us to another source material for Jewish traditions, and that
          is the Talmud and the Midrash.
        </p>
        <h5>
          <strong>The Talmud</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          “The Talmud is a collection of writings that covers the full gamut of
          Jewish law and tradition, compiled and edited between the third and
          sixth centuries.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Talmud is considered sacred by most Jews but is not on the same
          level of authority as the Scriptures. Michael is also referenced in
          the Talmud.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>Talmud Bavli Sanhedrin 38b</strong>, Michael is described
          as one of the four &apos;angels of mercy&apos; who intercede on behalf
          of humanity in the heavenly court. The other three angels are Gabriel,
          Raphael, and Uriel.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>Talmud Bavli Avodah Zarah 3b</strong>, Michael is depicted
          as one of the angels who accompanies God in his judgment of the
          nations. The text states that Michael speaks in defense of the people
          of Israel and presents their good deeds before God.
        </p>
        <h5>
          <strong>The Midrash</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          The Midrash “is an interpretive act, seeking the answers to religious
          questions (both practical and theological) by plumbing the meaning of
          the words of the Torah.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, think of Midrash as Jewish commentaries that attempt
          to explain certain passages in Scripture or aims to solve apparent
          discrepancies or inconsistencies in Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>The archangel Michael is also referenced in the Midrash.</p>
        <p>
          In{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Midrash Rabbah Genesis 68:10</em>
          </strong>
          , Michael is identified as one of the angels who accompany God on his
          visits to Abraham. According to the text, Michael is tasked with
          announcing the good news of Sarah&apos;s impending pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Midrash Tanhuma Vayakhel 6</em>
          </strong>
          , Michael is portrayed as an advocate for the people of Israel in the
          heavenly court. The text states that Michael intercedes on behalf of
          Israel, reminding God of the people&apos;s merits and beseeching him
          to show them mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Midrash Tadshe 23</em>
          </strong>
          , Michael is depicted as the guardian of the Garden of Eden. The text
          states that Michael guards the garden with a flaming sword, preventing
          anyone from entering.
        </p>
        <h5>
          <strong>Angel Worship and the Cult of Michael</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Since Michael is an exalted figure in Judaism, Some groups within
          Judaism and even in Christianity{" "}
          <em>(Christianity started out as a Jewish sect)</em> have resorted to
          elevating Michael and other angels to divine status. That is why the
          apostle Paul warned in Colossians 2:18 about the worship of angels
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              “Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship
              of angels disqualify you. Such a person also goes into great
              detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle
              notions by their unspiritual mind.” Col. 2:18
            </em>
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Rabbinic literature also prohibits the worship of Michael or any other
          angels because some Jews of that day have turned it into a practice.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              When distress comes upon a man, he should not cry out to either
              Michael or to Gabriel; instead, he should cry out to me, and I
              will answer him immediately. That is what is written: ‘Everyone
              who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved’. (j. Berakhoth
              9:13)
            </em>
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The practice of calling on to Michael, Gabriel or any other angel for
          help in time of need is discouraged in Judaism but encouraged in
          Catholicism as we shall see later.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are just some of the references to Michael found in the
          Intertestamental Literature. While these are not considered as
          authoritative by Protestants, it gives us a glimpse of what the
          average Jew in Jesus’ day believes in.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t know for sure how the Jews got their traditions about Michael
          and the other traditions that are not found in the Bible. According to
          them, Moses gave them the Written Torah, that is the first five books
          of the Bible and then he also passed down orally the Oral Torah to
          Joshua and Joshua to the the elders and in turn they passed to their
          descendants in an unbroken chain down to the rabbis. The final
          codification of this oral law was finished in the 3rd century AD and
          is called the Mishnah.

          This is authoritative for the Jews but for Christians, we do not
          recognize this as authoritative since we cannot ascertain which of
          these are transmitted from Moses or which are later additions or
          embellishment.

          Even Jesus said that Jews have traditions that they have inherited
          from their elders that are clearly of human origin
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              “You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to
              human traditions.” And he continued, “You have a fine way of
              setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own
              traditions!” Mark 7:8-9
            </em>

          Clearly the Jews recognize that Michael is not just an ordinary angel,
          as we have seen, and that they have given to Michael some of the
          attributes that Christians have given to Jesus Christ. Perhaps Michael
          is all that to the nation of Israel, but Michael and his role for the
          nation of Israel is just a type for the role of Jesus to the whole
          world. I guess it’s no surprise that the Jews may have misattributed
          the role of Jesus to Michael because the Jews do not recognize Jesus
          as the Son of God or as the Messiah. The Bible says,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              “He was in the world, and though the world was made through him,
              the world did not recognize him.” John 1:10
            </em>
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          But one thing is certain, the Jews do not believe that Jesus Christ
          and Michael the archangel are one and the same person. For them,
          Michael is the highest archangel and worthy of reverence while Jesus
          Christ is just a man claiming to be the Son of God and king of the
          Jews but was crucified for it.

          <strong>VERDICT: Jesus and Michael are not the same person.</strong>
