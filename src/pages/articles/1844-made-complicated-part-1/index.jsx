          In Douglas Adams&apos; popular sci-fi novel titled The
          Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy, a group of highly intelligent
          beings developed a supercomputer named Deep Thought, in order to
          determine the{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and
              Everything.
            </em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the story, it takes Deep Thought 7 ½ million years to compute the
          answer which just happens to be a seemingly random number,{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>42</em>

          If only the answer to all the questions about life is this simple and

          problems.

          Science fiction aside, there has been a much awaited event by
          Christians all over the world for over two millennia since the
          resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ, and that is the Second
          Advent. The First Advent of the Messiah has been prophesied in the
          Scriptures. Jews who believed that Jesus Christ is the Messiah have
          welcomed the Lord&apos;s arrival and they eventually became known as
          Christians, while Jews who did not believe in Him died still waiting
          for the First Advent of the Messiah. In the First Advent, there were
          many signs and prophecies scattered throughout Scriptures and even the
          Magi, who were not Jews were able to read the signs and guided by the
          Holy Spirit using the Star of Bethlehem, have made their way to
          worship the Lord. After Jesus&apos; ascension, many of the believers
          awaited eagerly for His soon return, believing that it would happen in
          their lifetime. But the hope that they have for Jesus&apos; soon
          return did not die with them. They have passed this hope to their
          children and their children&apos;s children down to our present
          generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good thing Jesus did not leave His followers clueless and left them
          many signs of His return. Some of these are:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="center">
            <em>
              You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you
              are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to

            </em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="center">

              There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these
              are the beginning of birth pains. Matt. 24:7-8
            </em>

          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          These signs have been visible since the time of the early Christians,
          and that&apos;s why some people from the time of the apostles began to
          doubt the second coming of the Lord.

          The Second Advent is soon. But from a human perspective, Our{" "}
          <em>&quot;soon&quot;</em> may be different from God&apos;s{" "}
          <em>&quot;soon&quot;</em>. The apostle Peter writes,
        </p>
        <blockquote>

              But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a

              The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand
              slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to
              perish, but everyone to come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:8-9

        <p>
          Sadly, some believers abandoned their faith and did not believe
          anymore that the Lord would return. Others however, with great zeal
          have been expecting the Lord and went on to predict His exact return,
          even down to the very day and hour. Had they remembered Jesus&apos;
          words, they would not have done this. Jesus said
        </p>

          Throughout history, many people have tried, and failed to predict the
          exact day of the Lord&apos;s return. These are but a few:

          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Harold Camping is the one that was fairly recent and has caught a lot
          of media attention. Harold Camping, through his group Family Radio,
          predicted that the end of the world would occur on May 21, 2011 and
          when it didn&apos;t happen, changed the date to October 21, 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of his believers donated money, amounting to millions of dollars.
          Others sold or gave away their properties believing that they will no
          longer need it but unfortunately, there were also some tragic cases of
          people killing themselves or their loved ones because of extreme fear
          or panic as the date drew near. Harold Camping himself died two years
          later in 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Family Radio administrators have repented of their date
          setting and Family Radio is still active to this day, just without the
          date setting. This is the sad reality when people were deluded into
          believing erroneous date setting for the Lord&apos;s return. What
          happened to Harold Camping&apos;s believers are eerily similar (except
          maybe for the cases of killings) to what happened with William Miller
          and the Millerite movement. And like the supercomputer Deep Thought
          who computed the answer to the{" "}

          Lord&apos;s return and how he got the result of 1844.

        <p align="center">

          />
          <br />
          <em>(1782-1849)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          William Miller was born on February 15, 1782, in Pittsfield,
          Massachusetts. He was a veteran in the American revolution and gained
          the rank of captain. After the war he became a farmer and took up
          civil duties such as constable, was elected as deputy sheriff and also
          served as Justice of the peace. Miller was born a Baptist but later
          converted to Deism. Deists believe in a Creator God but they also
          believe that after God created everything, He just left them to do
          whatever they please because He doesn&apos;t care. But after Miller
          experienced the horrors of war and how he was miraculously saved,
          Miller then came to believe that God was at work in saving him so he
          turned back to God and back to the Baptist faith and renounced Deism.
          William Miller was also an active member of the Freemasons until 1831,
          but he found it incompatible with the Bible so he left the group. His
          thorough study of the Bible led him to conclude that the Second Coming
          would be sometime around 1843. Miller based his calculation primarily
          on Daniel 8:14{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days;
              then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”
            </em>
          </strong>{" "}
          This is the commonly known verse on how Miller got to the year 1843,
          but this understanding came to him much later. Miller has developed
          his so-called{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>“15 proofs”</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          to show how he got to the date but we will discuss this briefly in a
          little bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller has no specific date for his prediction but he eventually
          narrowed down his calculation. According to Miller,{" "}
          <em>
            “My principles in brief are, that Jesus Christ will come again to
            this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with
            all the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844.{" "}
            <sup>[1]</sup>”
          </em>{" "}
          When the dates have passed without the Second Coming, Miller stated
          publicly,{" "}
          <em>
            &quot;I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment; yet I
            still believe that the day of the Lord is near, even at the door.{" "}
            <sup>[2]</sup>&quot;
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          But in August of 1844 at a camp-meeting in Exeter, New Hampshire,
          Samuel Snow <sup>[3]</sup> presented the seventh-month message or{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>“true midnight cry”</em>
          </strong>
          , which claims that the Lord would return on the &ldquo;
          <strong>
            <em>tenth day of the seventh month</em>
          </strong>
          &rdquo; using the{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Jewish Karaite Calendar</em>
          </strong>
          , this would correspond to <strong>October 22, 1844</strong>. However,
          like the previous dates that Miller predicted, this too ended up a
          failure, which came to be known as{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>“The Great Disappointment.”</em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <h2>The Aftermath of the Great Disappointment</h2>
        <p>
          <p>
            Because the Lord did not return on October 22, 1844 as the
            Millerites expected, The believers were publicly mocked and
            ridiculed, many of them sold all their possessions in anticipation
            of the Second Coming and have even convinced others to do the same
            as they wait for the Lord. William Miller wrote to Joshua Himes
            about his experience after the Great Disappointment
            <em>
              “Some are tauntingly enquiring, &apos;Have you not gone up?&apos;
              Even little children in the streets are shouting continually to
              passersby, &apos;Have you a ticket to go up?&apos; The public
              prints, of the most fashionable and popular kind ... are
              caricaturing in the most shameful manner of the &apos;white robes
              of the saints,&apos; Revelation 6:11, the &apos;going up,&apos;
              and the great day of &apos;burning.&apos; Even the pulpits are
              desecrated by the repetition of scandalous and false reports
              concerning the &apos;ascension robes&apos;, and priests are using
              their powers and pens to fill the catalogue of scoffing in the
              most scandalous periodicals of the day
            </em>
            <sup>[4]</sup>”
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          Before October 22, 1844, the Millerites numbered in the thousands. But
          after the failed date, the Millerite movement splintered. Some
          abandoned their belief in God totally, while others went back to their
          previous denominations. The remaining few went on to found their own
          denomination, among them are the Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses and
          Seventh-day Adventists.
        </p>
        <p />
        <p>
          Those who remained steadfast to the 1844 doctrine were utterly
          devastated. Hiram Edson, one of the Millerite followers, who later
          became one of the pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist church was
          recorded as stating,{" "}
          <em>
            “Our fondest hopes and expectations were blasted, and such a spirit
            of weeping came over us as I never experienced before. It seemed
            that the loss of all earthly friends could have been no comparison.
            We wept, and wept till the day dawned.<sup>[5]</sup>”
          </em>
          William Miller, in his personal memoirs also recorded{" "}
          <em>
            “Were I to live my life over again, with the same evidence that I
            then had, to be honest with God and man, I should have to do as I
            have done. I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment{" "}
            <sup>[6]</sup>”
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          What the Millerites, Harold Camping&apos;s Family Radio group, and
          other end-time date setters have experienced may be called{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Cognitive Dissonance</em>
          </strong>
          . According to Merriam-Webster dictionary cognitive dissonance is
          defined as{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              “Psychological conflict resulting from incongruous beliefs and
              attitudes held simultaneously”
            </em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The term came from the work of American psychologists,{" "}
          <strong>Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter</strong>.
          Interestingly, in the book that they published titled:{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              “When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern
              Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World <sup>[7]</sup>”
            </em>
          </strong>
          , the Millerites were included in the examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cognitive dissonance happens when you have a belief or knowledge{" "}
          <em>(cognition)</em> that is incompatible <em>(dissonance)</em> with
          another. An example would be, You know that smoking is bad for your
          health but at the same time, you feel relaxed and calm when you smoke
          and it relieves your stress. Resolving this cognitive dissonance is
          usually by:<sup>[8]</sup>
        </p>
        <p />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rejecting or avoiding conflicting information:</strong> In
            order to keep their beliefs, they will dismiss or close their minds
            to any information that is in conflict with their beliefs. This is
            also known as{" "}
            <strong>
              <em>“confirmation bias.”</em>
            </strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Persuading and justifying:</strong> Those who take this
            route will align themselves with similar minded people who will
            agree with them and they may also convince others that they are
            correct
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reconciling the differences:</strong> This attempts to make
            the dissonant beliefs compatible and when done in Biblical matters
            for example, is what can be called as{" "}
            <strong>
              <em>“hermeneutical gymnastics”</em>
            </strong>
            . A fanciful way of making the Bible agree with one&apos;s belief on
            a certain topic by twisting or manipulating, or taking it out of its
            context so it would fit that belief.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p />
        <p>
          The faithful Millerites had a hard time accepting what was going on at
          that time, they didn&apos;t know why the Lord did not return as
          predicted by Miller. They knew his calculations were correct and his
          proofs irrefutable and yet Christ did not return. However, their
          belief did not conform to reality because the Lord didn&apos;t return
          as they predicted, hence the cognitive dissonance.

          On the morning of October 23, 1844, hours after the{" "}
          <strong>Great Disappointment</strong>, the faithful Millerites
          gathered at the home of Hiram Edson, and they spent the morning in
          prayer. After their prayer, Edson, together with Owen Crosier went to
          visit the other Millerites to encourage them. As they were passing
          through a cornfield, Hiram Edson stopped in his tracks and Owen
          Crosier asked him why he was stopping, Edson replied:{" "}
          <em>
            “The Lord was answering our morning prayer, by giving light with
            regard to our disappointment <sup>[9]</sup>”
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In Edson&apos;s vision he wrote that{" "}
          <em>
            “Heaven seemed open to my view, and I saw distinctly and clearly
            that instead of our High Priest coming out of the Most Holy of the
            heavenly sanctuary to come to this earth on the tenth day of the
            seventh month, at the end of the 2300 days, that He for the first
            time entered on that day the second apartment of that sanctuary; and
            that He had a work to perform in the Most Holy before coming to this
            earth. That He came to the marriage at that time [as mentioned in
            the parable of the Ten Virgins]; in other words, to the Ancient of
            days to receive a kingdom, dominion, and glory; and we must wait for
            His return from the wedding <sup>[10]</sup>”
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This vision gave their group new hope that what Miller taught was
          correct. They had renewed vigor. They were given the right
          understanding. Miller&apos;s date was correct but they got the event
          wrong.{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              Instead of the earth being cleansed and Christ returning, it was
              the Heavenly Sanctuary that was being cleansed and Christ entering
              the Most Holy Place for the first time
            </em>
          </strong>
          . We will take a closer look if this was indeed the case or perhaps
          this could be Hiram Edson&apos;s way of reconciling the cognitive
          dissonance that they had just experienced?
