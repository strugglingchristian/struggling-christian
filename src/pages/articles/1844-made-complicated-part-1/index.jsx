        In Douglas Adams’ popular sci-fi novel titled The Hitchhiker&apos;s
        Guide to the Galaxy, a group of highly intelligent beings developed a
        supercomputer named Deep Thought, in order to determine the Answer to
        the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. In the
        story, it takes Deep Thought 7 ½ million years to compute the answer
        which just happens to be a seemingly random number, 42. If only the
        answer to all the questions about life is this simple and can be
        calculated by a computer, it would certainly solve a lot of our
        problems.
