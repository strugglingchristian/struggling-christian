          In Douglas Adams&apos; popular sci-fi novel titled The
          Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy, a group of highly intelligent
          beings developed a supercomputer named Deep Thought, in order to
          determine the{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and
              Everything
            </em>
          </strong>
          . In the story, it takes Deep Thought 7 ½ million years to compute the
          answer which just happens to be a seemingly random number,{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>42</em>
          </strong>
          . If only the answer to all the questions about life is this simple
          and can be calculated by a computer, it would certainly solve a lot of
          our problems.

          Science fiction aside, there has been a much awaited event by
          Christians all over the world for over two millennia since the
          resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ, and that is the Second
          Advent. The First Advent of the Messiah has been prophesied in the
          Scriptures. Jews who believed that Jesus Christ is the Messiah have
          welcomed the Lord&apos;s arrival and they eventually became known as
          Christians, while Jews who did not believe in Him died still waiting
          for the First Advent of the Messiah. In the First Advent, there were
          many signs and prophecies scattered throughout Scriptures and even the
          Magi, who were not Jews were able to read the signs and guided by the
          Holy Spirit using the Star of Bethlehem, have made their way to
          worship the Lord. After Jesus&apos; ascension, many of the believers
          awaited eagerly for His soon return, believing that it would happen in
          their lifetime. But the hope that they have for Jesus&apos; soon
          return did not die with them. They have passed this hope to their
          children and their children&apos;s children down to our present
          generation.

          Good thing Jesus did not leave His followers clueless and left them
          many signs of His return. Some of these are:

        <p align="center">

            You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are

          These signs have been visible since the time of the early Christians,
          and that’s why some people from the time of the apostles began to
          doubt the second coming of the Lord.

          The Second Advent is soon. But from a human perspective, Our{" "}

            Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand
            slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to

          Sadly, some believers abandoned their faith and did not believe
          anymore that the Lord would return. Others however, with great zeal
          have been expecting the Lord and went on to predict His exact return,
          even down to the very day and hour. Had they remembered Jesus&apos;
          words, they would not have done this. Jesus said

          Throughout history, many people have tried, and failed to predict the
          exact day of the Lord&apos;s return. These are but a few:

        </p>
        <p>
          Harold Camping is the one that was fairly recent and has caught a lot
          of media attention. Harold Camping, through his group Family Radio,
          predicted that the end of the world would occur on May 21, 2011 and
          when it didn&apos;t happen, changed the date to October 21, 2011. Many
          of his believers donated money, amounting to millions of dollars.
          Others sold or gave away their properties believing that they will no
          longer need it but unfortunately, there were also some tragic cases of
          people killing themselves or their loved ones because of extreme fear
          or panic as the date drew near. Harold Camping himself died two years
          later in 2013. Meanwhile, Family Radio administrators have repented of
          their date setting and Family Radio is still active to this day, just
          without the date setting. This is the sad reality when people were
          deluded into believing erroneous date setting for the Lord&apos;s
          return. What happened to Harold Camping’s believers are eerily similar
          (except maybe for the cases of killings) to what happened with William
          Miller and the Millerite movement. And like the supercomputer Deep
          Thought who computed the answer to the{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything</em>

            <em>42</em>
          </strong>
          , we will explore how Miller derived the calculation of the
          Lord&apos;s return and how he got the result of 1844.

          <br />
          <em>(1782-1849)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          William Miller was born on February 15, 1782, in Pittsfield,
          Massachusetts. He was a veteran in the American revolution and gained
          the rank of captain. After the war he became a farmer and took up
          civil duties such as constable, was elected as deputy sheriff and also
          served as Justice of the peace. Miller was born a Baptist but later
          converted to Deism. Deists believe in a Creator God but they also
          believe that after God created everything, He just left them to do
          whatever they please because He doesn&apos;t care. But after Miller
          experienced the horrors of war and how he was miraculously saved,
          Miller then came to believe that God was at work in saving him so he
          turned back to God and back to the Baptist faith and renounced Deism.
          William Miller was also an active member of the Freemasons until 1831,
          but he found it incompatible with the Bible so he left the group. His
          thorough study of the Bible led him to conclude that the Second Coming
          would be sometime around 1843. Miller based his calculation primarily
          on Daniel 8:14{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days;
              then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”
            </em>
          </strong>{" "}
          This is the commonly known verse on how Miller got to the year 1843,
          but this understanding came to him much later. Miller has developed
          his so-called{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>“15 proofs”</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          to show how he got to the date but we will discuss this briefly in a
          little bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller has no specific date for his prediction but he eventually
          narrowed down his calculation. According to Miller,{" "}
          <em>
            “My principles in brief are, that Jesus Christ will come again to
            this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with
            all the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844.{" "}
            <sup>[1]</sup>”
          </em>{" "}
          When the dates have passed without the Second Coming, Miller stated
          publicly,{" "}
          <em>
            &quot;I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment; yet I
            still believe that the day of the Lord is near, even at the door.{" "}
            <sup>[2]</sup>&quot;
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          But in August of 1844 at a camp-meeting in Exeter, New Hampshire,
          Samuel Snow <sup>[3]</sup> presented the seventh-month message or{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>“true midnight cry”</em>
          </strong>
          , which claims that the Lord would return on the &ldquo;
          <strong>
            <em>tenth day of the seventh month</em>
          </strong>
          &rdquo; using the{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Jewish Karaite Calendar</em>
          </strong>
          , this would correspond to <strong>October 22, 1844</strong>. However,
          like the previous dates that Miller predicted, this too ended up a
          failure, which came to be known as{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>“The Great Disappointment.”</em>
