          Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses and Seventh-day Adventists claim that Jesus
          Christ is also the Archangel Michael. Both of these denominations came
          from the Millerite movement so it’s no surprise that they believe the
          same thing. William Miller, the founder of the Millerite movement,
          wrote in an exposition of Daniel 12:1,<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="center">
            <em>
              “Michael, in this passage, must mean Christ; He is the great
              Prince, and Prince of princes” (Evidences From Scripture and
              History of the Second Coming of Christ [1840], pp. 108, cf. p.
              209).”
            </em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          When Jesus did not return in 1844 as William Miller predicted, many of
          the Millerites returned to their previous denominations or abandoned
          their faith entirely, but one group continued and later on organized
          themselves and became known as Seventh-day Adventists, while another
          group became the Jehovah’s Witnesses. These groups shared similar
          doctrines; aside from the belief that Michael and Jesus are one and
          the same person, they also believe in soul-sleep<sup>2</sup> and
          annihilationism<sup>3</sup>. And while the official position of the
          Seventh-day Adventist church today is Trinitarian, (there are some
          groups within SDA who are non-trinitarians) SDAs too started off as
          sharing the Arian<sup>4</sup> belief that Jesus Christ is not co-equal
          with God. Some of the SDA pioneers who held this belief include
          <sup>5</sup>: James White, Uriah Smith, Joseph Bates, R.F. Cotrell and
          many more. But SDA belief has some differences about the Arian
          teaching, hence it was called Semi-Arian<sup>6</sup>. Semi-Arians
          believe that Jesus is not the Almighty God, but He is a divine being
          just not equal with the Father and He has a beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, the SDA church adopted the Trinitarian belief<sup>7</sup>{" "}
          <em>
            (with some notable differences from the orthodox trinitarian
            position, but that is a topic for another time)
          </em>{" "}
          while the Jehovah’s Witnesses stayed true to Arianism, or rather a
          modified version of it. The Arians have no problem with praying to
          Jesus Christ but Jehovah’s witnesses would only pray to Jehovah. But
          even though the SDAs adopted the Trinitarian doctrine, they still
          retained the belief that Michael and Jesus Christ are one and the same
          person. The main difference with Jehovah’s Witnesses is that Jehovah’s
          Witnesses believe Jesus/Michael is a created being and a lesser
          divinity than the Father, while SDAs on the other hand believe that
          Jesus/Michael is a member of the Godhead and co-equal with the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          But where did this teaching come from? To my knowledge, the presbyter
          Arius, who founded Arianism in the 4th century did not believe that
          Jesus and Michael are one and the same person. But that teaching has
          got to come from somewhere and that’s what we are going to unravel.

          <strong>
            <u>Michael in the Bible</u>
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          The name Michael is a very old Hebrew name. It comes from the Hebrew
          מִיכָאֵֽל (mī kāʼēl) meaning “Who is like God?” This name according to
          the Ancient Hebrew Research Center<sup>8</sup> is a shortened form of
          the question that is asked in Psalm 113:5{" "}
          <em>
            “Who is like the LORD our God, the One who sits enthroned on high.”
          </em>{" "}
          This is a rhetorical question because there is no one like God{" "}
          <em>(Isaiah 46:9)</em>. Michael is one of the many theophoric
          <sup>9</sup> names found in the Bible like Gabriel, Daniel, Joel,
          Raphael, Ezekiel etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first mention of the name Michael is found in Numbers 13:13 and it
          mentions Sethur, the son of Michael. Sethur is one of the spies sent
          by Moses to the land of Canaan. There are 16 occurrences<sup>10</sup>{" "}
          of the name Michael in the Bible, 11 of which refers to humans and
          only 5 refer to the angel. Let’s take a look at these five verses and
          see if it says unequivocally that Jesus and Michael are one and the
          same person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we proceed, I strongly suggest that you read first the whole
          chapter of Daniel 10 in order to understand this in full context. It
          would be better if you could read chapters 10-12 but it would be best
          if you could read the whole book of Daniel.

          There is another reference to the archangel found in 1 Thess. 4:16, It
          says:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              “For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud
              command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call
              of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.” 1 Thess. 4:16
            </em>
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          For many Protestants, they identify Michael as the archangel spoken of
          in the verse above, and their understanding is that when the Lord
          returns to the earth, He will be accompanied by myriads of angels as
          also attested by Jude.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              “Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: “See, the
              Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones, to
              judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts
              they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant
              words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” Jude
              1:14-15.&quot;
            </em>
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Interestingly, this passage from Jude is very similar to an earlier
          non-canonical book called the “Book of Enoch” and is an almost exact
          quotation.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <span align="center">
            <em>
              “And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones To
              execute judgment upon all, And to destroy all the ungodly: And to
              convict all flesh. Of all the works of their ungodliness which
              they have ungodly committed, And of all the hard things which
              ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.” 1 Enoch 1:9&quot;
            </em>
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Many scholars believe that the Jude passage is referencing the Book of
          Enoch account or that both of them may have drawn from an earlier
          unknown source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Majority of Christians have no issue with identifying the archangel in
          1 Thessalonians as Michael but they have in no way identified the
          archangel as the Lord himself because that is not the orthodox
          position of Christianity. However for Jehovah’s Witnesses and
          Seventh-day Adventists, this verse somehow supports their position
          that Jesus and Michael are one and the same person.
        </p>
        <p>
          But plain reading of the verses above does not explicitly state that
          Michael is Jesus in any way whatsoever. Perhaps this is one of those
          doctrines like the Trinity which isn’t explicitly stated yet the
          concept is revealed in Scriptures? We shall see if that is the case
          when we exegete these verses later. Meanwhile, let’s take a look first
          at how Michael is viewed in the Jewish tradition.
