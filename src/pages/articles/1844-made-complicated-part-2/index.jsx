        <h2>The Aftermath of the Great Disappointment</h2>
        <p align="justify">
          Because the Lord did not return on October 22, 1844 as the Millerites
          expected, The believers were publicly mocked and ridiculed, many of
          them sold all their possessions in anticipation of the Second Coming
          and have even convinced others to do the same as they wait for the
          Lord. William Miller wrote to Joshua Himes about his experience after
          the Great Disappointment
          <em>
            “Some are tauntingly enquiring, &apos;Have you not gone up?&apos;
            Even little children in the streets are shouting continually to
            passersby, &apos;Have you a ticket to go up?&apos; The public
            prints, of the most fashionable and popular kind ... are
            caricaturing in the most shameful manner of the &apos;white robes of
            the saints,&apos; Revelation 6:11, the &apos;going up,&apos; and the
            great day of &apos;burning.&apos; Even the pulpits are desecrated by
            the repetition of scandalous and false reports concerning the
            &apos;ascension robes&apos;, and priests are using their powers and
            pens to fill the catalogue of scoffing in the most scandalous
            periodicals of the day

          Before October 22, 1844, the Millerites numbered in the thousands. But
          after the failed date, the Millerite movement splintered. Some
          abandoned their belief in God totally, while others went back to their
          previous denominations. The remaining few went on to found their own
          denomination, among them are the Jehovah’s Witnesses and Seventh-day
          Adventists.

          Those who remained steadfast to the 1844 doctrine were utterly
          devastated. Hiram Edson, one of the Millerite followers, who later
          became one of the pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist church was
          recorded as stating,{" "}
          <em>
            “Our fondest hopes and expectations were blasted, and such a spirit
            of weeping came over us as I never experienced before. It seemed
            that the loss of all earthly friends could have been no comparison.
            We wept, and wept till the day dawned.<sup>[5]</sup>”
          </em>
          William Miller, in his personal memoirs also recorded{" "}
          <em>
            “Were I to live my life over again, with the same evidence that I
            then had, to be honest with God and man, I should have to do as I
            have done. I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment{" "}
            <sup>[6]</sup>”
          </em>

        <p align="justify">
          What the Millerites, Harold Camping’s Family Radio group, and other
          end-time date setters have experienced may be called{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Cognitive Dissonance</em>
          </strong>
          . According to Merriam-Webster dictionary cognitive dissonance is
          defined as{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              “Psychological conflict resulting from incongruous beliefs and
              attitudes held simultaneously”
            </em>
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The term came from the work of American psychologists,{" "}
          <strong>Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter</strong>.
          Interestingly, in the book that they published titled:{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              “When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern
              Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World <sup>[7]</sup>”
            </em>
          </strong>
          , the Millerites were included in the examples.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Cognitive dissonance happens when you have a belief or knowledge{" "}
          <em>(cognition)</em> that is incompatible <em>(dissonance)</em> with
          another. An example would be, You know that smoking is bad for your
          health but at the same time, you feel relaxed and calm when you smoke
          and it relieves your stress. Resolving this cognitive dissonance is
          usually by:<sup>[8]</sup>
        </p>

        <p align="justify" />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rejecting or avoiding conflicting information:</strong> In
            order to keep their beliefs, they will dismiss or close their minds
            to any information that is in conflict with their beliefs. This is
            also known as{" "}
            <strong>
              <em>“confirmation bias.”</em>
            </strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Persuading and justifying:</strong> Those who take this
            route will align themselves with similar minded people who will
            agree with them and they may also convince others that they are
            correct
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reconciling the differences:</strong> This attempts to make
            the dissonant beliefs compatible and when done in Biblical matters
            for example, is what can be called as{" "}
            <strong>
              <em>“hermeneutical gymnastics”</em>
            </strong>
            . A fanciful way of making the Bible agree with one&apos;s belief on
            a certain topic by twisting or manipulating, or taking it out of its
            context so it would fit that belief.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p />

        <p align="justify">
          The faithful Millerites had a hard time accepting what was going on at
          that time, they didn&apos;t know why the Lord did not return as
          predicted by Miller. They knew his calculations were correct and his
          proofs irrefutable and yet Christ did not return. However, their
          belief did not conform to reality because the Lord didn’t return as
          they predicted, hence the cognitive dissonance.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          On the morning of October 23, 1844, hours after the{" "}
          <strong>Great Disappointment</strong>, the faithful Millerites
          gathered at the home of Hiram Edson, and they spent the morning in
          prayer. After their prayer, Edson, together with Owen Crosier went to
          visit the other Millerites to encourage them. As they were passing
          through a cornfield, Hiram Edson stopped in his tracks and Owen
          Crosier asked him why he was stopping, Edson replied:{" "}
          <em>
            “The Lord was answering our morning prayer, by giving light with
            regard to our disappointment <sup>[9]</sup>”
          </em>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          In Edson’s vision he wrote that{" "}
          <em>
            “Heaven seemed open to my view, and I saw distinctly and clearly
            that instead of our High Priest coming out of the Most Holy of the
            heavenly sanctuary to come to this earth on the tenth day of the
            seventh month, at the end of the 2300 days, that He for the first
            time entered on that day the second apartment of that sanctuary; and
            that He had a work to perform in the Most Holy before coming to this
            earth. That He came to the marriage at that time [as mentioned in
            the parable of the Ten Virgins]; in other words, to the Ancient of
            days to receive a kingdom, dominion, and glory; and we must wait for
            His return from the wedding <sup>[10]</sup>”
          </em>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This vision gave their group new hope that what Miller taught was
          correct. They had renewed vigor. They were given the right
          understanding. Miller&apos;s date was correct but they got the event
          wrong.{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              Instead of the earth being cleansed and Christ returning, it was
              the Heavenly Sanctuary that was being cleansed and Christ entering
              the Most Holy Place for the first time
            </em>
          </strong>
          . We will take a closer look if this was indeed the case or perhaps
          this could be Hiram Edson&apos;s way of reconciling the cognitive
          dissonance that they had just experienced?
