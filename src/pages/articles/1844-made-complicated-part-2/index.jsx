        <h2>Evolution of the 1844 doctrine</h2>
        <p>
          The 1844 doctrine or Sanctuary doctrine of the Seventh-day Adventists
          underwent several iterations from the time of Miller before reaching
          its final form as Seventh-day Adventists know it today. Let&apos;s now
          take a quick look at the evolution of this unique doctrine of
          Seventh-day Adventists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having been born and raised as a Seventh-day Adventist, I have heard
          about the 1844 doctrine but I had very little knowledge about it.
          Sometimes I hear 1844 being mentioned in sermons and in evangelical
          crusades that I had attended growing up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I had no deep understanding of this doctrine yet, by seeing
          the charts and hearing the explanations, my young mind at that time
          was convinced that this doctrine was correct, although I don&apos;t
          fully understand it. It&apos;s like seeing a math professor solve a
          complex equation and in a few minutes time, the whole whiteboard was
          filled with the numbers and symbols until arriving at the correct
          solution. That&apos;s how I felt when I saw the charts, the symbols,
          the graphics. Like smoke and mirrors in a magic show, I was
          mesmerized.

          Like I&apos;ve mentioned before, William Miller derived 1844 at a much
          later date, with the help of Edward Snow and also after 1843 failed.
          He was focused on the year 1843 as that is what his calculations were

          <em>(at the time of this writing)</em>, I too am one of them. But
          before Miller found out about 1844, he had his mind set on an earlier

          Long before William Miller came to Daniel 8:14, or the 2300 year
          prophecy as SDAs call it, he first came up with the 2520 year

              literal and mystical; which seven times cannot be understood less
              than seven times 360 revolutions of earth in its orbit, making
              2520 years. I believe this began according to Jeremiah 15:4,
              &quot;And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the

              Babylon, and Israel was no more a nation, —see chronology, 2

          <p>
            My initial reaction upon reading Miller&apos;s 1st proof is one of
            bewilderment. How does one even think that by
            <strong>
              <em>
                &nbsp;multiplying 7 by 360 to get 2520 and then turn it to years

            </strong>
            to get the date of the return of the Lord?.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let&apos;s try to unravel Miller&apos;s logic on how he derived his
            proof, but before we do that. We need to accept a few assumptions.
            You do not need to agree with this but in order to understand
            Miller&apos;s thinking, we have to think like Miller. So let&apos;s
            get on to it.

        <p>
          For now, we will not be discussing the validity of the day-year
          principle. For the sake of understanding Miller&apos;s proof, we just
          have to accept this assumption as valid.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Assumption 2: Whenever year or <em>“times”</em> are mentioned in
            prophecy, this always refers to 360 days &nbsp;
          </strong>
          <em>(which can be converted to years if needed)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          We all know that <u>a year is equivalent to about 365 and 1/4 days</u>
          . The ancients were also aware that a year contains more than 360
          days. Even the Babylonians who employed a 360-day calendar needed to
          add an extra month at irregular intervals to compensate for the
          missing days. If intercalary days were not added, then the 360 day
          calendar year would have missing days and would not correspond to our
          current timeline.
        </p>

          <strong>360-day calendar vs 365-day calendar</strong>
          &nbsp;<em>(4 years)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a 360-day calendar year will be 5 less days than a
          365-day calendar like the ones we have. But every 4 years, we add 1
          day to the month of February to make up for the missing ¼ day yearly.
          So 4 years in a 360-day calendar <em>(without intercalation)</em> will
          be 21 days less than our 365-day calendar
          <em>(which is more accurate)</em>.
        </p>

          &nbsp;<em>(4 years)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the 360-day calendar without intercalation for 100 years, would
          result in 525 fewer days or around 1 1/2 years to the current time.
          This would make it seem that the 360-day calendar is ahead by 1 1/2
          years. Using this 360-day calendar without intercalation for 1000
          years would result in a missing 5250 days or 14 years and 3 months
          compared to the current time. So using this 360-day calendar for 2300
          years without intercalation would result in 12,075 days lacking or
          equivalent to 33 years. This would make the 360-day calendar ahead by
          33 years if used for a span of 2300 years.

          . Maybe the prophetic year <em>(360-day)</em> is just like the
          commercial year <em>(also 360 days)</em> in the finance world. But
          unless the prophetic timelines don&apos;t corresponed to reality,
          using this 360-day calendar wouldn&apos;t align with the dates of
          history. So let&apos;s just forget reality for now. It&apos;s always

        <p>
          Now that we have those 2 assumptions in place, let&apos;s now take a
          look at Miller&apos;s 1st proof. How did Miller come up with 2520
          years again? He got this from Leviticus 26:18-27. Let&apos;s look at
          verse 18.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <em>
            “If after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for
            your sins seven times over.” Leviticus 26:18.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Miller believed that the people of God had been captured in Babylon
          <em>&nbsp;(literal and mystical)</em> for a period of 2520 years. That
          is the{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>seven times</strong>
          </em>{" "}
          mentioned in Leviticus 26:18 &nbsp;
          <em>
            <strong>multiplied by 360</strong>
          </em>{" "}
          which according to Miller, are the
          <em>
            <strong>360 revolutions of the earth in its orbit</strong>
          </em>
          , and voila, you get 2520, which also according to Miller is
          equivalent to 2520 years. Ok, so now that Miller has 2520 years, then
          how did it end up in 1843? Miller believed that a Messianic prophecy
          which is found in Isaiah 7:14-17 has an initial fulfillment which is
          the starting date of the 2520 year prophecy.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <blockquote>

          According to Miller&apos;s interpretation, from the time that this
          prophecy was given, <strong>65 years</strong> will pass and Ephraim
          will be too shattered to be a people. Miller believed that this
          prophecy was given in <strong>742 BC</strong>, if you subtract 65
          years from that, you will get <strong>677 BC</strong>, which Miller
          believed was when Manasseh was taken captive by the Assyrians. Thus,
          677 BC is the starting date of the 2520 year prophecy. Subtract that
          from 2520 and you get 1843.

          But was Miller correct in his proof? According to him, based from
          Isaiah 7:8, From the time that the prophecy was given
          <strong>(742 BC)</strong> to 65 years later
          <strong>(677 BC)</strong> Manasseh will be carried captive to Babylon
          and Israel will no longer be a nation, but archaeological records show
          that in 721 BC, Samaria fell to Assyria and its inhabitants were
          deported and replaced with other inhabitants. So 742 BC couldn&apos;t
          have been the starting point of the prophecy in Isaiah 7:8 because in
          742 BC, Israel was no longer a nation, when in Isaiah 7:8 says, in 65
          years, Ephraim <em>(which is a part of Israel)</em> will be too
          shattered to be a people, meaning at the time the prophecy was given,
          they were not yet shattered. If 742 BC couldn&apos;t be the starting
          point of the prophecy, then 677 BC couldn&apos;t be the end point of
          that prophecy also. Then it means that 677 BC couldn&apos;t be the
          starting point of 2520 and 2520 is also just a <em>“magic”</em>{" "}
          number, calculated by multiplying 7 by 360. Ok then, let&apos;s get on
          to the next proof, perhaps it offers more substance.

          You may think this equation is the same as the equation from
          Miller&apos;s first proof. Well, you are correct. The equation is the
          same but the way it was derived is a bit different.

              Beginning with the captivity of Israel and the king of Judah,
              Manasseh, 677 B. C., must end in A. D. 1843, when the children of

        <p>In this 2nd proof, Miller used Deuteronomy 25: 1-2:</p>

              anyone among their own people, because the Lord&apos;s time for
              canceling debts has been proclaimed. Deuteronomy 25:1-2.

        <p>
          According to Miller, God&apos;s people will be delivered from bondage
          after they have served 7 prophetic years. 7 prophetic years multiplied
          by 360 years is 2520. And not surprisingly, the starting date of that
          is also 677 BC which, according to Miller is Manasseh&apos;s arrest
          and captivity of Israel from proof number 1. But we now know how
          improbable that is, then we also know how valid Miller&apos;s 2nd
          proof is.

          Now this proof is a bit more complicated than the first two proofs
          above. In order for Miller&apos;s proof to be plausible, one would
          need a lot of imagination in order to manipulate the verse to fit the
          timeline. When I first read about Miller&apos;s proofs, I was mind
          blown. But we will not go through all 15 proofs, you can just explore
          them at your own leisure. We&apos;ll just pick a couple more.

              Sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the
              space of the seven Sabbaths of years shall be unto thee, forty and
              nine years. Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to
              sound, on the tenth day of the seventh month, on the day of
              atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your
              land. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
              throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof: it
              shall all be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every, man
              unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his
              family. A jubilee that fiftieth year be unto you; ye shall not
              sow, neither reap which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the
              grapes in it of thy vine undressed. For it is the jubilee; it
              shall be holy unto you, ye shall eat the increase thereof out of
              the field. In the year, of this jubilee, ye shall return every man
              unto his possession.&quot; Now, if we can show any rule whereby we
              can find the antitype, we can tell when the people of God will
              come into the inheritance of the purchased possession, and the
              redemption of their bodies, and the trump of jubilee will proclaim
              liberty, a glorious one, through all the land. In order to do this
              we must take notice of the order of the Sabbaths. &quot;Seven
              Sabbaths shall be complete.&quot; There are seven kinds of
              Sabbaths, which all have seven for a given number.

              It is very evident no year of release or Jubilee was ever kept

              the commandments of the Lord, or kept his statutes. This
              king&apos;s reign ended B. C. 607. See 2 Kings 23d chapter, 2
              Chron. 35 and 36 chapters, and Jeremiah 22d chapter. After which
              the Jews never kept, neither could they keep, a year of release,
              or Jubilee; for neither their kings, their nobles, their people,
              or their lands could have been redeemed after this. Jer. 44:20‑23.
              Here ended the Jewish Jubilee, they had not kept more than 21
