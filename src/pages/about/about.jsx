          Struggling is hard. Struggling is not fun. Struggling is inconvenient.
          Why struggle when you can go with the flow? In this day and age, it's
          easy to just give up, be your natural self and be one with the world.
          But as Christians, we were called by God to a higher standard. We are
          in this world, but we are not of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are called by God to love the people of the world, but we are not
          to love the world and it's false belief systems that are in conflict
          with God. It would be easier to be politically correct all the time
          and not step on anybody's toes and hope we can all get along and love
          each other and live in peace but the reality is this is extremely
          hard, if not impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, Jesus himself said that He did not come to bring peace but
          a sword.
