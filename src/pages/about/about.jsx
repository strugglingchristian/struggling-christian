          Do you remember a day when you did not sin one bit? If you do, then
          good for you. I could barely make it to a few hours before I knew I'd
          done something wrong that could be considered as sinful. It kind of
          reminds me of the sign that’s posted on factories indicating the last
          time they had an accident. When everything is going well, sometimes
          the counter could go on for a number of days without any incident, and
          it creates a good feeling for everyone working there. But there are
          also days when anything that could go wrong would go wrong and the
          counter would reset to zero. And the cycle begins again, until the
          next accident happens.

          That is how I feel about my Christian life. I try to avoid committing
          sin but more often than not, the more I try to avoid sin, the more I
          fall into sin. The Apostle Paul penned it so accurately:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="center">
            <em>
              I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do,
              but what I hate I do. <sup>16</sup>And if I do what I do not want
              to do, I agree that the law is good. <sup>17</sup>As it is, it is
              no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.{" "}
              <sup>18</sup>For I know that good itself does not dwell in me,
              that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is
              good, but I cannot carry it out. <sup>19</sup>For I do not do the
              good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on
              doing. <sup>20</sup>Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no
              longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.{" "}
              <br />
              Romans 7:15-20
            </em>

        <p>You’re probably thinking one of the following things:</p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If you’re a Jew, just don’t violate any of the 613 commandments of
              the Torah and if you have committed some sin, you can repent,
              fast, give to charity, and do some other <em>mitzvot</em> and
              you’ll be fine.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you’re a Muslim, avoid doing the major and minor sins, repent
              and observe the <em>Five Pillars</em> of Islam.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you’re Catholic, try not to do any mortal sins as they are a
              sure ticket to damnation. But if you do sin, just confess to a
              priest, do some penance and in the unfortunate event that you died
              and have found yourself in purgatory instead of heaven, your
              living loved ones could give indulgence to help you on your way to
              heaven. Too bad if you’re in hell, though, you’re gonna stay there
              forever.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you’re a Christian who believes in eternal security, you might
              say, “You shouldn’t trouble yourself about this because there is
              nothing on earth or heaven that can take away your salvation.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you’re a Christian who believes in conditional security, you
              might say “why worry about sinning when you have already been
              saved by grace through faith and that the Holy Spirit is at work
              in you so you would produce the fruit of the Spirit”
            </li>
            <li>
              If you’re an atheist, you might say, “What sin? All you need to do
              is obey the laws of the land, treat others with respect, be
              sensitive to other people’s culture, be mindful of another’s
              preferred pronouns, etc, etc - basically just don’t be a jerk,
              that’s it.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you’re a Hindu or Buddhist, doing bad deeds would keep you
              trapped in this constant cycle of deaths and rebirths so you
              should keep on racking up those good points by performing good
              deeds to cancel out your bad karma
            </li>
            <li>
              Or you’re probably thinking about something else that I haven’t
              mentioned but that is beside the point.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>But I’ll just focus on Christianity for now.</p>
        <p>
          Why struggle as a Christian? Struggling is hard. Struggling is not
          fun. Struggling is inconvenient. In this day and age where convenience
          is expected, it would be easier to not struggle. It would be easier if
          you could just be your natural self and conform to the world's
          standards and be one with the world. As the saying goes,{" "}
          <em>“If you can’t beat them, join them.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Most of the time, I conform.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Then feel guilty.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Then repent.</p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Then try to do good on my own for
          a while…
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Then back to sin
          again.
        </p>
        <p>Lather. Rinse. Repeat.</p>
        <p>
          After a while, this gets tiresome and it kind of makes me wonder
          whether I’ve been truly saved or not. I would like to believe I have
          the assurance of salvation. After all, the apostle Paul says in
          Ephesians that
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="center">
            <em>
              For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith— and this is
              not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that
              no one can boast. <br />
              Ephesians 2:8-9
            </em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But why don’t I feel saved?</p>
        <p>
          That’s the million dollar question. But I also I know for a fact that
          my feelings are unreliable but it can certainly affect every aspect of
          my life. It sets off a train of thought in my mind like this — If I
          don’t feel saved maybe I wasn’t even saved in the first place, or
          perhaps I was saved and then at some point, I have grieved the Holy
          Spirit and He left me so now I’m on my own. Thoughts like this keep me
          defeated and bound to sin. Until I realized that I was trying to do
          the work on my own. When I read what Paul said in Philippians:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="center">
            <em>
              being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will
              carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. <br />
              Philippians 1:6
            </em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I was doing it the wrong way all along. I’ve been saved indeed by
          grace through faith and not by works. Yet here am I doing all the work
          when it is God who began a good work and will carry it on to
          completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think my problem was I was conflating salvation with sinlessness and
          perfection. Sinless perfection is not achievable from this side of
          eternity.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="center">
            <em>
              If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth
              is not in us. <br />1 John 1:8
            </em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          But the fact that you and I are struggling against sin means that the
          Holy Spirit is at work in us; Changing our hearts and minds and making
          us aware of our sins and our constant need for a Savior; Reminding us
          that we are to take our crosses daily and follow Jesus. Sure we may
          stumble along the way and feel like such a loser, but we must get up
          and move forward. It says in 1 John 1:9
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="center">
            <em>
              If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive
              us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. <br />1 John
              1:9
            </em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And the writer of Hebrews urges us to struggle against sin.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="center">
            <em>
              In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the
              point of shedding your blood.
              <br />
              Hebrews 1:4
            </em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          So whatever your situation may be, don't be discourged and keep on
          struggling. You may be a work in progress but know that God is at work
          in you and will complete it until the day of Christ.
