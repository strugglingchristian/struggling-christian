                      In Douglas Adams&apos; popular sci-fi novel titled The
                      Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy, a group of highly
                      intelligent beings developed a supercomputer named Deep
                      Thought, in order to determine the Answer to the Ultimate
                      Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. In the
                      story, it takes Deep Thought 7 Â½ million years to compute
                      the answer which just happens to be a seemingly random
                      number, 42. If only the answer to all the questions about
                      life is this simple and can be calculated by a computer,
                      it would certainly solve a lot of our problems.
